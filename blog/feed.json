Sort of.</p><h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"intro\">Intro<a href=\"#intro\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Intro\" title=\"Direct link to Intro\">​</a></h2><p>Over the weekend, I finally had some time to get started (and stuck) on the project.\nMost of it was just getting the basics set up and running, things like git repos and router DNS/DHCP settings.\nSince this is the first time I am doing such a project, my goal for the end of the weekend was to be able to serve a Next.Js page using my personal sub-domain name over my LAN.</p><p>I shall attempt to write these posts for someone that has zero idea of how such networking things work (me 3 weeks ago basically) and bring you along my thought processes and the steps that I took to get to where I am in the project currently.</p><p>I will assume basic knowledge in things like what is an IP address, domain name and how to navigate your router's settings.\nI will also be linking resources that I have used to keep this as brief as possible.</p><h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"router\">Router<a href=\"#router\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Router\" title=\"Direct link to Router\">​</a></h2><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"why-start-here\">Why Start Here<a href=\"#why-start-here\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Why Start Here\" title=\"Direct link to Why Start Here\">​</a></h3><p>The router is what contains the 2 key parts of the project that will eventually allow you to use a domain name to reach your server rather than using an IP address.</p><ul><li><p>DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) Server: this allows your router to dynamically assign local IP addresses to your devices.\nThe router \"leases\" that address to you device for a set time (usually 24 hours) before it reassigns it.\nThis ensures that there are always local IP addresses on your nework for new devices to join to.</p></li><li><p>DNS (Domain Name System) Server: this service converts domain names - example.com - to IP addresses.\nThis makes things easier for us since we can easily remember words not a series of numbers.\nMost routers will have a setting for you to define which DNS servers to use as default.</p></li></ul><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"router-goal\">Goal<a href=\"#router-goal\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Goal\" title=\"Direct link to Goal\">​</a></h3><p>What we need to do is to give our server that hosts our applications (host server) a fixed IP address so that we do not have to keep reassigning new IP addresses to our domain name.\nWe also need to use a DNS server to to map our domain name to the host server's IP address.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"router-steps\">Steps<a href=\"#router-steps\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Steps\" title=\"Direct link to Steps\">​</a></h3><p>Firstly, we need to \"reserve\" an IP address for our host server.\nLuckily most routers come with a setting called DCHP Reservation that allows us to do just that.\nYour router will list all the currently connected devices and their associated MAC and IP addresses as shown below.\nRefer to your router's manual for how to reserve IP addresses.</p><table><thead><tr><th align=\"center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"DCHP Reservation\" src=\"/assets/images/dhcp-server-02bb346d28490a6e029b182de6f2e644.png\" width=\"1173\" height=\"962\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align=\"center\"><strong>DCHP Reservation</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Now that our computer has a fixed (static) IP address, it will forever be reachable at this address even if the computer disconnects and reconnects to the network at a later time.</p><p>Second, the DNS server.\nWe will get to setting up the server later on, but first we need to decide where the DNS server is running.\nSome routers come with a DNS server built in, which makes this whole process a lot easier, while for most you have to set one up yourself.</p><p>For my router, a Linksys E9450, it does not come with a DNS server and by default takes whatever is set on the WAN (which in my case will be my Internet Service Provider's (ISP) DNS server.\nIt also has a setting for me to set primary and secondary DNS servers manually which is what I used for my setup.</p><p>I decided to run my DNS server on the same host server as my applications, just to make things simpler.\nThus, I set the static DNS addresses on the router as the following:</p><ul><li><p>Primary: 8.8.8.8 which is Google's DNS server</p></li><li><p>Secondary: 192.168.79.19 which is my computer's local IP address.</p></li></ul><p>The router will send any DNS queries that fail to be resolved to my DNS server.</p><p>Like what you are reading thus far? Consider becoming a subscriber and stay up to date on my tinkering.</p><h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"dns-server\">DNS Server<a href=\"#dns-server\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to DNS Server\" title=\"Direct link to DNS Server\">​</a></h2><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"dns-goal\">Goal<a href=\"#dns-goal\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Goal\" title=\"Direct link to Goal\">​</a></h3><p>Now that we have a static address for the DNS Server as well as the host server, we need to let the DNS server know where to find the host server.\nFor now they are both the same but that might not be the case in the future or for you.\nWe will have to insert an 'A' Record which maps a URL to an IPv4 address.\nSimilarly, there is also an 'AAAA' record that does the same with IPv6 addresses but we are keeping things simple here.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"dns-steps\">Steps<a href=\"#dns-steps\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Steps\" title=\"Direct link to Steps\">​</a></h3><p>I followed the tutorial by Christian Lempa which uses a Bind9 server running in Docker to handle the DNS functionality.\nThis might be a bit overkill for most of us but I think its a good stepping stone going forward.\nAs he also mentions in his follow-up video, he extends the setup to use Terraform to dynamically add new entries to the DNS server and manage the records that are currently present.</p><p>His tutorial is pretty easy and straightforward to follow, but if you want to see what I have done with my setup, you can refer to my networking repository.\nI have left out the access control list portion for now but may reinstate it in the future depending on my needs.</p><h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"webpage\">Webpage<a href=\"#webpage\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Webpage\" title=\"Direct link to Webpage\">​</a></h2><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"webpage-goal\">Goal<a href=\"#webpage-goal\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Goal\" title=\"Direct link to Goal\">​</a></h3><p>Now that our client devices (any other device on the network) can find our host server using a URL, in my case with the <!-- -->*<!-- -->.local.bhargav.io endpoints, we need to serve something from the host server for clients to see.\nSince I will be making a Next.js application, I just wanted them to be able to see the default splash screen of the framework when it is first installed.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"webpage-steps\">Steps<a href=\"#webpage-steps\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Steps\" title=\"Direct link to Steps\">​</a></h3><h4 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"caddy\">Caddy<a href=\"#caddy\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Caddy\" title=\"Direct link to Caddy\">​</a></h4><p>Since I am running all my applications in Docker, I will need something that serves content from the correct container based on the URL that was used to reach the host server.\nAccessing the containers based on their port numbers - e.g. <code>auth.local.bhargav.io:3000</code> is not a feasible solution since I will run into Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing (CORS) issues later on.\nEvery site has to be served on port 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS.</p><p>Thus we need a reverse proxy that matches the url to the correct docker container running the requested service.\nCaddy is a server that does exactly that.\nIt is simple to use, lightweight and blazingly fast.\nSince it will be running in the Docker environment as well, we need to map each incoming URL to the corresponding docker container.\nFor example:</p><p><code>http://auth.local.bhargav.io</code> <!-- -->→<!-- --> <code>http://auth_frontend:3000</code></p><p><code>http://auth.local.bhargav.io/api/*</code> <!-- -->→<!-- --> <code>http://auth_backend:8000</code></p><p>You can refer to the code in the networking repository for more details of the specifics of the implementation.\nAll the various services are orchestrated in the docker-compose.yml files.</p><h4 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"nextjs-server\">Next.JS Server<a href=\"#nextjs-server\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Next.JS Server\" title=\"Direct link to Next.JS Server\">​</a></h4><p>At this point, our client can query the DNS for the IP of the host server, the request will then reach Caddy who will match the url to the correct docker container.\nNow we just need the container for caddy to serve.</p><p>This is relatively straightforward if you have any experience with Dockerfiles and building and running your own custom containers.\nEssentially what the Dockerfile will do is to spell out steps to create and start our frontend application as its own standalone container.</p><p>We are just going to start off with the default code that comes when setting up Next.js.\nThe Dockerfile is available on the auth frontend repository.\nThis container is then built and orchestrated on the same internal network as Caddy with Docker Compose.</p><table><thead><tr><th align=\"center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"docker-compose.yml\" src=\"/assets/images/docker-compose-file-e036b36355739ae0a826c54b333d7adb.png\" width=\"1919\" height=\"978\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align=\"center\"><strong>docker-compose.yml</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"results\">Results<a href=\"#results\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Results\" title=\"Direct link to Results\">​</a></h2><p>Once the containers are built successfully, we can navigate to our auth url and we see the following:</p><table><thead><tr><th align=\"center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Error Page\" src=\"/assets/images/site-cannot-be-reached-253baf64c755a51616ec193c4c40c111.png\" width=\"1915\" height=\"975\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align=\"center\"><strong>Error Page</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Err...\nWhy is the page not being served?</p><p>When running nslookup on the DNS server for a random subdomian vs the auth subdomain, the following happens:</p><table><thead><tr><th align=\"center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Cannot find auth page\" src=\"/assets/images/cannot-find-auth-8831594a67592735b3e68ab28ea4f00e.png\" width=\"518\" height=\"198\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align=\"center\"><strong>Cannot find auth page</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Cannot find IP for auth but can for hello</p><p>This is strange and not supposed to happen.\nThere was no record for hello and yet it was being served.\nThis is something that I still have to look into since I want to be able to finely control the urls that are accesible.</p><p>On the bright side at the very least I can indeed access the host server and display something using a URL.\nI still have some troubleshooting to do and if you have any idea where I went wrong, please do let me know.\nI will send many appreciations your way.</p><p>To end off the week's work, I also set up the backend server in Django, built its Docker container and deployed it in a similar fashion to the auth frontend.\nThe only difference being that now the frontend is the catchall for any url pathways that do not start with /api.</p><h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"conclusion-and-next-steps\">Conclusion and Next Steps<a href=\"#conclusion-and-next-steps\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Conclusion and Next Steps\" title=\"Direct link to Conclusion and Next Steps\">​</a></h2><p>This has been a great weekend thus far, and I wouldn't have thought that I will be able to achieve so much in such short time (literally a day??).\nThe first obvious next step is to figure out why the DNS server is not behaving as it should.\nIs there some other service that is hindering my progress.\nGoing to be using this article to get some idea as to how to solve these issues.</p><p>Once that is resovled, I will look into setting up SSL for the site to ensure that there is a secure connection betweeen my applications and my devices.</p><p>Then I will look at running the services from a computer that is not the one that I am coding on.\nI do have a spare Mac Mini that has been sitting around on my desk for the longest time and it would be great to put it to some use.\nI had recently updated the hard drive from a disk drive to an SSD so that will help things like boot speed.\nSince it is not supported beyond MacOS Catalina, I might just intall Ubuntu on it at the tradeoff of a nicer MacOS UI.\nDecisions.</p><p>The next bit of infra that I need is to set up github actions that run locally on my host machine.\nThis will allow me to push code changes to the repository, run checks and once that is done, I can automatically deploy the changes to the Docker environment without me ever having to manually log into the system and make changes.</p><p>Once that is done, then I can finally move onto writing the applications proper.\nStick around to find out how that turns out.\nUntil next time!</p><p>Found this insightful?

personal cash flows but at the same time, I hope to learn a lot more about Networking, Self-Hosting and Systems Architecture.</p><h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"overview\">Overview<a href=\"#overview\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Overview\" title=\"Direct link to Overview\">​</a></h2><p>First, a little bit about the inspiration for this project.\nEveryone should at some point start to keep track of their finances to be a financially responsible adult.\nAs I have finally entered the workforce and have access to tools like a credit card, it becomes harder to keep track of my spending with multiple avenues for money to exit from my sphere of control.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"existing-options-and-their-shortfalls\">Existing Options and Their Shortfalls<a href=\"#existing-options-and-their-shortfalls\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Existing Options and Their Shortfalls\" title=\"Direct link to Existing Options and Their Shortfalls\">​</a></h3><p>Like many of us, I have asked around amongst my friends and researched online for great apps that will help me in this area.\nI have also previously been a user of apps like <a href=\"https://seedly.sg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Seedly</a> which has allowed me to sync my transactions directly from my bank account but DBS, my primary bank of choice, has <a href=\"https://seedly.sg/posts/hi-is-there-any-update-regarding-syncing-with-dbs-or-this-is-gone-case/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">suspended third-party sync</a>.</p><h4 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"great-features\">Great Features<a href=\"#great-features\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Great Features\" title=\"Direct link to Great Features\">​</a></h4><p>I am currently using <a href=\"https://www.dobin.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dobin</a>, which is a locally developed application that also has the ability to sync to your bank accounts (including DBS, which I am not sure how they do that).\nThey understand that having multiple accounts will involve some amount of self-transfers between accounts and thus have a handy switch to mark transactions as such and thus they are omitted from cashflow calculations.\nHowever, despite there being a handy \"Net Cashflow\" bar that tells you if you spent more money that month than received, the UI is a bit janky despite the clean look and there is no search function as well to find the transactions that you are looking for.</p><h4 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"digital-wallets\">Digital Wallets<a href=\"#digital-wallets\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Digital Wallets\" title=\"Direct link to Digital Wallets\">​</a></h4><p>The key issue is that there has been a proliferation of digital wallets and since they are separate from the bank accounts that most people have.\nThese wallets do not provide the robust tools that most banks provide to their customers in terms of exporting their data.\nFor example, PayLah! only allows you to export your transactions as a PDF file as compared to a more usable CSV file.\nThis is also true for credit card statements.</p><p>This means that you either have to manually add the transactions to your app, which is ridiculous since the entire thing is an automated system, or be content with just labelling the transaction as a \"Transfer\" or \"Other Income\" when you move money in or out of your wallets respectively.</p><div class=\"theme-admonition theme-admonition-note alert alert--secondary admonition_LlT9\"><div class=\"admonitionHeading_tbUL\"><span

link to Group Payments\" title=\"Direct link to Group Payments\">​</a></h4><p>For me the greatest issue are the times when I go out with friends and end up paying first for the meal, following which everyone will proceed to transfer money to me.\nThis means that the budgets that I have set in my application do not show the reality of how much money that I actually spent as the incoming money transferred by the other people enjoying the meal should offset the payment made by the person that paid first.\nThis is also an issue for things like flights where making group bookings is by one person is the norm.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"ideal-product\">Ideal Product<a href=\"#ideal-product\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Ideal Product\" title=\"Direct link to Ideal Product\">​</a></h3><p>There will always be some tradeoffs when creating such a personal budgeting application.\nBy having to manually refresh your transactions every time, you might not have a live understanding of your spending as data is not pushed to your app but pulled manually.\nSince statements are created at the end of the month for most digital wallets, they can only be processed once per month.</p><p>The key thing for me personally is that since I mostly make digital transactions as compared to cash transactions, I just want a place for me to see all my transactions for the month and just ensure that I am not blowing my budget at the end of it.\nI think I can reasonably rely on the internal tools of the various banking apps to have some sort of idea of how much I am spending and how much I have left to spend.</p><h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"project-scope\">Project Scope<a href=\"#project-scope\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Project Scope\" title=\"Direct link to Project Scope\">​</a></h2><p>There are going to be multiple moving parts to this project.\nSome of them are infrastructural and will then be reused for future projects while others are dedicated specifically for this project.\nThe end goal of this project is not just the creation of a personal expenses app but also a local applications infrastructure that I can use to create any other application that I want.\nI will refrain from connecting it to the internet for security reasons but that will be in the pipeline when my skills are sufficient for me to handle that.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"common-infrastructure\">Common Infrastructure<a href=\"#common-infrastructure\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Common Infrastructure\" title=\"Direct link to Common Infrastructure\">​</a></h3><p>I will need to set up the following as common infrastructure:</p><ol><li>Local DNS resolver that points <code>*.local.bhargav.io</code> to all the various services that I will have running on my local network.</li><li>Some sort of Docker environment to run the apps as containers.</li><li>An Auth server that will handle the creation of users and the managing of JWT tokens.</li><li>A message queue that will handle all the synchronisation of user changes and any other app specific processing that might need to be done.</li><li>Some sort of automated deployment pipeline like <code>Github Actions</code> but with the target being my local server rather than some cloud infrastructure.</li></ol><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"tools\">Tools<a href=\"#tools\" class=\"hash-link\"

aria-label=\"Direct link to Django\" title=\"Direct link to Django\">​</a></h4><p>Going back to my comfort zone here, but Django and its amazing Pythonic ways allows me to create the scripts that I need and add in all the plugins that I could ever ask for, including data processing pipelines and machine learning models (if I ever decide to in the future).</p><h4 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"nextjs\">NextJS<a href=\"#nextjs\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to NextJS\" title=\"Direct link to NextJS\">​</a></h4><p>This is another classic Web development Framework that I personally love to use that has routing built in so that you can focus on building web pages and their components.\nIt is also built on top of React which is a great framework for building Web apps.</p><h4 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"caddy\">Caddy<a href=\"#caddy\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Caddy\" title=\"Direct link to Caddy\">​</a></h4><p>This will end up being the main tool that I will use to reverse proxy my requests as well as ensure HTTPS on the requests.\nIt is a wonderful lightweight and easy to customise tool that handles a lot of the grunt work behind the scenes and has modules that you can load to add extra functionality instantly.</p><h4 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"rabbitmq\">RabbitMQ<a href=\"#rabbitmq\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to RabbitMQ\" title=\"Direct link to RabbitMQ\">​</a></h4><p>This is something new to my repertoire of tools as I have never worked with a message queue before.\nIt will be interesting to figure out how to make it work properly.\nThis might even change in the future if there is a better one that I can use.</p><h4 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"bind9\">Bind9<a href=\"#bind9\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Bind9\" title=\"Direct link to

and the need for me to have some way of resolving my local DNS addresses to the right IP address, I will just be following his tutorials to set up the home networking infrastructure.\nI am not a networking professional but I think it will be interesting to learn how to set up the home network and get the site to work.\nI am also not sure if this component is fully necessary as if Caddy can just broadcast to the whole network where to find the correct Docker containers, that would be great.\nFor now, I will keep it in though.</p><h4 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"docker\">Docker<a href=\"#docker\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Docker\" title=\"Direct link to Docker\">​</a></h4><p>This will be used to host all containers that are running my services as well as the Caddy and DNS instances.\nIt's just a great tool to ensure that all the necessary dependencies for each service are present and do not interfere with other services.</p><h4 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"terraform\">Terraform<a href=\"#terraform\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Terraform\" title=\"Direct link to

order for me to package and deploy the services that I am creating quickly and efficiently onto my local network, I will need to run Github Actions on a local runner so that it can easily access the correct docker environment.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"additional-considerations\">Additional Considerations<a href=\"#additional-considerations\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Additional Considerations\" title=\"Direct link to Additional Considerations\">​</a></h3><p>For now at least I don't want this infrastructure to be exposed to the internet as that will involve adding additional security measures that I feel I am not equipped to handle at this moment.</p><p>Another thing is that I am not sure if putting all the services in Docker will be the right way to go.\nChristian uses Proxmox to run virtual machines that host his applications and services, which might make it easier for the DNS service and Caddy will only have to worry about reverse proxying on individual machines running a frontend and backend each rather than across multiple Docker services.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\"

definitely take some time as I have to do my research, I think it will take 6 months or so to be fully set up.\nI estimate that it will be about 3 months or so for me to set up the infrastructure, a month for the Authentication app and 2 months for the expenses app.</p><h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"parting-words\">Parting Words<a href=\"#parting-words\" class=\"hash-link\"

Is there something unique or distinctive about your approach or expertise?</li><li>Are there any specific values or principles that guide your work in the technology field?</li><li>Is there a particular message or impression you would like your website visitors to have about your skills and talents?</li></ol></blockquote><h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"content-generation\">Content Generation<a href=\"#content-generation\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Content Generation\" title=\"Direct link to Content Generation\">​</a></h2><p>Upon <a href=\"#appendix\">answering the questions above</a> the model felt that it was satisfied with my answers and it had enough context to start generating what I had asked it to.\nIt is important to remember that the questions have to be answered in as much detail as possible.\nIt is ok to skip questions that are not relevant or just indicate that to the model.</p><p>This is in some part a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocchio_algorithm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rocchio Algorithm</a> where you are nudging the model closer and closer to what you actually want it to do.\nI guess understanding search engines goes some way in understanding how these models work as well.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"hero\">Hero<a href=\"#hero\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Hero\" title=\"Direct link to Hero\">​</a></h3><p>The following was the Hero that was generated with a handy explanation of why it did so</p><blockquote><p>Title: \"Transforming Industries with Technology and Data Insights\"</p><p>Subtitle: \"Full Stack Software Engineer | AI &amp; Machine Learning Specialist\"</p><p>This title and subtitle showcase your expertise in both full stack software engineering and artificial intelligence/machine learning.
