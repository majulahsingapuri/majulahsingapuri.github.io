						<h2>Background</h2>
						<p>
							These 2 projects were done during our Algorithms module and I was working with <a>Timothy</a>, <a>Jethro</a> and <a>Nicholas</a> as we hadn't worked together before so this was a perfect opportunity for us to.
							These 2 deliverables combined weighed in at 30% of our grade and we only had about 4 weeks to work on each of them, which isn't a lot of time given all the other work that we have to do.
							I am glad that we managed to pull it off and actually did a good job in the process.

							<h3>String Matching</h3>
							<p>Knot the easiest thing to do.</p>
						</header>
						
						<h4>The Problem</h4>
						<p>
							String searching has been a problem that has been around years and there are many ways to go about looking for Substrings in a String.
							The problem given to us was to find all occurances of a Substring in a String of DNA.
							This is relatively easier as there are only 4 letters that can occur in a String of DNA.
							However, the complexity comes in the form of length.
							DNA chains are extremely long and a naive search can take extremely long to search through the String.
						</p>

						<h4>Approach</h4>
						<p>
							A quick look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String-searching_algorithm">Wikipedia</a> reveals a treasure trove of already existing algorithms for use.
							We had to come up with 2 algorithms in a language of our choice.
							The first being a Brute Force algorithm and the second being an algorithm of our choice, be it a pre-existing one or one of our own creation.
							For the latter, we decided to implement the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth–Morris–Pratt_algorithm">Knuth Morris Pratt</a> algorithm as well as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-way_string-matching_algorithm">Two-Way String Matching</a> algorithm and see which one is the better one.
						</p>

						<h4>Implementation</h4>
						<p>
							The Brute Force was pretty straightforward to implement: have a <code>for</code> loop that runs down the length of the String and a <code>while</code> loop that checks through the search key until a mismatch, if any.
							It then prints out the locations of the occurances.
						</p>

						<p>
							For the other 2 algorithms, the Two-Way String Matching turned out to be the trickier one as it requires a critical factorisation.
							It was also the only algorithm that didn't have a more modern implementation available on the web.
							I only found <a href="https://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~lecroq/string/node26.html">one version</a> of it written in <code>C</code>, which meant that I had to decipher what it was trying to do and rewrite it in Python.
							Nicholas worked on the KMP algorithm implementation and it worked just as expected.
						</p>

						<h4>Analysis</h4>
						<p>
							Since this is an Algorithms module, the analysis of the algorithm, in terms of the preprocessing and actual run complexity, is just as important as the code.
							This is where Jethro and Timothy came in and did up a superb analysis of the algorithms.
							We decided to discard the Two-Way algorithm as the analysis was pretty complex and we had more uncertainties about analysing it as compared to the KMP.
							The effort wasn't gone to waste though as we all learnt something new from that venture.
						</p>

						<h4>Conclusion</h4>
						<p>
							This was a pretty interesting project as I got to see first hand what are the different methods of searching through Strings to find Substrings.
							As an end user you dont really need to think about such things when you're in an application and you press <code>⌘</code>/<code>Ctrl-F</code>.
							As an introduction to basic Algorithms, this project was pretty informative as to the real world use of Algorithms.
							<!-- Due to my background in competitive programming, I have always understood the need for efficient algorithms but seeing it in use first-hand really puts things into perspective. -->

						<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
						<p>
							Due to my background in competitive programming, I have always understood the need for efficient algorithms but seeing it in use first-hand really puts things into perspective.
							Both of these projects have shown how differnet algorithms are used in different scenarios in order to help us achieve tasks in the quickest way possible.
