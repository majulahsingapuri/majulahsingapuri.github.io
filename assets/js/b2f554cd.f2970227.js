Databases\\n2. Algorithms\\n3. Deep Learning\\n4. Software Engineering\\n5. Information Retrieval\\n6. Machine Learning\\n7. Time Series Analysis\\n8. Multivariate Analysis\\n9. Probability and Statistics\\n10. Calculus\\n11. Linear Programming\\n12. Simulation in Finance\\n\\nAll of these topics helped build my foundational knowledge in computing as well as mathematics.\\n\\n### Internship\\n\\nDuring my time at school, I interned at [Upskills Pte. Ltd](https://upskills.com) for 3 months, as well as [Vertex Holdings Pte. Ltd](https://vertexholdings.com) for 15 months.\\nThe latter being a part of [Work Study Degree Programme](https://www.skillsfuture.gov.sg/workstudy/wsdeg) where I had to do an extensive internship and a Final Year Project with the company.\\n\\nYou can read more details on my experiences in the `Projects` Section.\\n\\n## Work\\n\\nNow that I have completed University, I will be working at UOB Group\'s Technology Department as a Software Engineer.\\nI look forward to solving interesting challenges that the bank faces and helping them to build up their infrastructure."}]}')}}]);
