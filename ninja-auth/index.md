Welcome to Django Ninja Auth, a one stop shop for all your [Django-Ninja](https://github.com/vitalik/django-ninja) Authentication needs.
Supports REST authentication with Sessions, Auth Tokens and JWTs.

Fully Customisable to suit your needs.

:::note

This repository does not fix any issues in `SimpleJWT` or `django-ninja-jwt`.
It is intended to build upon the repository and add other forms of authentication on top of just JWTs.
